# WindH2
A repository for my thesis work. The foundation of this research is supported by NREL and CU-Boulder. My thesis is using a co-optimization approach to design wind and hydrogen energy systems. By designing an off-grid wind farm with the sole intent to generate hydrogen through electrolysis, we can achieve Green Hydrogen production at scale. Green Hydrogen has the potential to be the technology linking renewable electricity systems (RES), such as wind and solar, and 'hard to abate' or non-electrified industries. These industries include long-haul transportation, chemical industry, agriculture, steel manufacturing, and aviation fuel. 

Currently, 'hard to abate' industries generate hydrogen through fossil fuel processes, such as steam-methane reclaimation. However, as wind and solar efficienies increase and costs decrease, RES can surpass the fossil fuel industries ability to generate hydrogen. Within this repository are scripts, modified source code, and analysis tools to achieve my goals.
